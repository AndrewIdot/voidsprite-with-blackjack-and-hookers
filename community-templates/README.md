# voidsprite custom template collection

This folder contains **custom templates** made by voidsprite contributors / maintainers. 

## installation

In order to install a custom template, close voidsprite and navigate to the following directories:

**Windows**:

```DISK:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\voidsprite\templates```

**Linux**:

```~/.config/voidsprite/templates```

After that, move the voidsn files into the **templates** folder. The newly installed templates should appear in the template drop-down menu on the launchpad next launch.

## creation

In order to create your own template, all you need to create a **.voidsn** or **.png** file. However, make sure to follow the guidelines outlined below:

* The template must have distinct and easily distinguishable colours 

* The template must colour-code different segments

* The template must be annotated via the Comment tool (if you are exporting it as a .voidsn file) or with easily-readable symbols / numbers (if you are exporting as a .png). It is ideal to utilize both, which makes .voidsn the recommended export format

* The comments must be short and clear in order to not take up too much space on the template.

* The filename of the template must represent its purpose clearly (for example, RPGMaker 2003 (the engine) Chipset (what the template is for) is recommended)
