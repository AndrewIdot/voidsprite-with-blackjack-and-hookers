# voidsprite custom pattern collection

This folder contains **custom patterns** made by voidsprite contributors / maintainers. 

## installation

In order to install a custom pattern, close voidsprite and navigate to the following directories:
**Windows**:
```DISK:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\voidsprite\patterns```
**Linux**:
```~/.config/voidsprite/patterns```
After that, move the bitmap files into the **patterns** folder. The newly installed patterns should appear in the pattern menu on next launch.

## creation

In order to create your own pattern, all you need to do is to create a **.pbm (portable bitmap)** or **.xbm (x bitmap)** file utilizing 2 colours at most (0xFFFFFF and 0x000000).
The pattern may be of any size or shape.
